A todo list where each task has
  - Sub tasks
  - Time estimates
  - Deadline
  - Pomodoro
  - Priority
  - Enthusiasm

Recurring tasks:
  - Creates a subtask on a recurring interval
  - Duplicates last completed task? Edits are pushed forward then

Start my day, a function that tries to balance high priority tasks with tasks that will get you going:
 I.e short, high enthusiasm task to kick things off before going into a high priority low enthusiasm task.
 Optional: set an amount of work time, to prioritize getting things done

Should there be a 'balance' value? Enthusiasm vs priority: getting tasks done
Should there be a 'buffer' value? Average amount of over/under shoot for tasks - specific to larger tasks.

Priority and enthusiasm should be linked lists.

Starting a task:
  Set a focus time (optional: use default) and break time (optional: use default)

Break time:
  If not finished, queue up the next task if current is low priority. Can choose to continue with task. Should add warning if not enough time is allocated, considering buffer.
